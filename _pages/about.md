Currently I'm a research intern working on security for large language models at BAIR. I'm really fortunate to be advised by Prof. [David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/) and Postdoc [Zhanhao Hu](https://whothu.github.io/).
I obtained my B.S. degree at [School of Computer Science, Wuhan University](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes robustness machine learning and AI safety.

Previously I worked with Prof. [QianZhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/) from [School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/).
